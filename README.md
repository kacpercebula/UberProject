## Introduction
- This project aims to analyze and visualize a dataset of Uber trips in New York City. The cleaning was simple. I needed to bind all the months data together, then convert the date/time column to be workable with filters. The analysis includes pivot tables, charts, heat maps, and a geospatial map created using the Leaflet library in Shiny. The charts display trips taken by hour, month, day, and base. Heat maps visualize trips by hour, day, month, week, and base. The geospatial map displays trip data on a map of New York City. All visualizations aim to provide insights into the trends and patterns of Uber trips in the city.

## Data Cleaning 
1. Selected the columns we deemed necessary or useful for analysis and changed the variable names for easier referencing

## Data Preparation :hammer:
1. Created pivot tables (grouped by team) for the six distinct stats involved in the Historical_Strength metric
